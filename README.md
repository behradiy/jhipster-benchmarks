a brief explanation by auther:

I created a performance benchmarks GitHub repository, with applications generated by JHipster.

Those applications are more complex and realistic than simple "hello, world" applications created with Spring Boot. For instance, they use Spring Security and Spring Boot Actuator: those libraries will impact application start-up time and performance, but they are what you would use in the real world.

Then, they are not as complex as they could be: I didn't configure a database or an application cache. Those would make running performance tests a lot more complicated, and wouldn't add any specific value: as we would use the same drivers or caching solution with all three application servers, we would end up testing the same things.

In the GitHub repository, you will find 4 directories: one for each application, and one with the performance tests.
